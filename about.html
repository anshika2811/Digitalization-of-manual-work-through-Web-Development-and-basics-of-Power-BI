                <p> <span><u>Body in white (BIW) is the stage in automobile manufacturing in which a car body's frame has been joined together, that is before painting and before the motor, chassis
                     sub-assemblies, or trim (glass, door locks/handles, seats, upholstery, electronics, etc.) have been integrated into the structure.</u></span><br/><br/>
                     <i> Assembly involves different techniques such as welding (spot, MIG/MAG, or friction stir), riveting, clinching, bonding and laser brazing.
                    The term derives from manufacturing practices before steel unibody monocoques, when automobile bodies were made by outside 
                    firms on a separate chassis with an engine, suspension, and bumpers attached.[citation needed] The manufacturers built or purchased wooden bodies (with thin, non-structural metal sheets on the outside) to bolt onto the frame. The bodies were painted white prior to the final color.[according to whom?]                    
                    A folk etymology for "body in white" is the appearance of a car body after it is dipped into a white bath of primer 
                    (undercoat paint)— despite the primer's actual gray color.[citation needed] BIW could also refer to when car bodywork would be made of
                     timber – all timber products, furniture, etc., are considered to be "in the white" when at the stage of raw timber before finishing or
                      varnishing.[original research?]                   
                    In car design, the "body in white"[inconsistent] phase is where the final contours of the car body are worked out, in preparation for
                     the ordering of the expensive production stamping die. Extensive computer simulations of crash-worthiness, manufacturability, and 
                     automotive aerodynamics are required before a clay model from the design studio can be converted into a body in white ready for
                      production.[citation needed]                   
                    Factories may offer BIW cars to racers, who then may replace up to 90% of the car with aftermarket parts,[1] and niche manufacturers 
                    like Ruf Automobile start their cars with BIWs from other makers.</i></p>
